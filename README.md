SpringJ is a tool for designing optimal helical compression springs. Helical compression springs are one of the most commonly used mechanical components, found in automobiles, homes, fitness equipment, and widely used in industrial settings. The performance of the spring directly affects the working state of the machine it is in, impacting not only the efficient use of energy but also directly increasing production speed. Designing a spring to work optimally as expected is a complex problem. SpringJ aims to solve this problem!

## Features
SpringJ offers users the **Flexibility** to design various optimization types. 
- Users can select any combination of design parameters as target design parameters, any combination of constraints from the constraints list, and finally choose the spring attribute to be optimized from the attributes list. 
- For example, a combination of Wire diameter, Inner diameter, and Total coils can be designed to achieve the maximum Spring index and Spring ratio, while satisfying constraints such as Outer diameter, Maximum shear stress, and Coil binding gap.
- After the user makes their design, the product will perform a **Feasibility Analysis** to check the theoretical validity of their design. If the design passes the feasibility analysis, SpringJ will provide the user with the optimal design parameters!
